## Machine Learning Project to predict whether a car bought at an auction is a good or bad buy


Here is the notebook link for this project - https://jovian.ai/singh-pankaj0018/machine-learning-logistic-regression-problem

The Dataset was downloaded from Kaggle Competition that has 70k rows and 33 different categories.

Performed EDA and brings insights from the dataset, performed data imputation and structure the final data for Machine Learning models.

Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest Models using Scikit-Learn library.

Submitted the results and achieved the score within the top 25% on the competition leaderboard.
